# The Very First Daisi™ Hackathon
This is my attemt to this competition. I have created an appllication that will check toxicity on a piece of text.

The technology I have used are:
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [unitary/toxic-bert](https://huggingface.co/unitary/toxic-bert)

## Important links
* [Competition page](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/the-very-first-daisitm-hackathon/)
* [Daisi documentation](https://doc.daisi.io/)

## Usage
There is a `requirements.txt` file, install the Python packages in a new virtual environment using

> pip install -r requirements.txt

once you install all the required packages, you can run the following file to see the results, for the first time, `it will take time depending on your internet connection since it will download the unitary/toxic-bert model`.

> python test.py

there is also a `Streamlit` UI as well, you can run the UI

> streamlit run main.py
